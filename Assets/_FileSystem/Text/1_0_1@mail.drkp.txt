[Subject]    This might interest you
[Content]

So, I've just come upon something that might interest you. I was just training on some old computers here on my man network and found something odd; this computer, named just 'genesis', had a unnamed hidden file, the content follows:
    Those who seek knowledge, knowledge shall have. Today we've accomplished what we set out to do so many years ago: "organize the human knowledge and make it accessible to anyone, anywhere". We've finished digitalizing almost every single published book. We've indexed every single web page. Virtually all of human knowledge is now accessible to anyone with a internet connection.
    I speak to you today to announce that all this knowledge is now secure on a data center specially built for the servers who hold this information. This data center was built to endure any circunstances that human kind has seen. No atomic explosion, no natural disaster, nothing can penetrate this data centers. They've been cealed with their own nuclear-power supply and will never run out of power.
    These servers hold a backup of our databases with all of our data and will serve as a time capsule for future humans or alien civilizations to know everything that we know today.

    I believe it's a transcript of some kind of presentation. Can you imagine something like this? Do you think it's real? I mean, if this person is saying the truth, this server might still be up and running. Imagine having access to all human knowledge? I know it's knowledge of 300 years ago, but considering the cirscunstances, I think we could use some of this. I'll contact some people to see if they know something about this, maybe the elders will know something.
	Anyway, I thought this could interest you. Hit me up if you need anything, I'll keep in touch.
