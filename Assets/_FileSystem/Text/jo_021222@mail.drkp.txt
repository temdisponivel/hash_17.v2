    I couldn't find anything else on the computer, but I've finished my recovery of the SSD. There was a lot of lost data, but maybe you can find something more there.
    
    I've setup an old SSH on it so you can log in.
    
    Here's the IP address and password: 
    201.196.145.53 trustno1
    
    And one of the elders here told me about this person that might know something about this transcript. He's an old hacker who tried to prove that the profecy is real.
    He is supposed to know everything there is to know about the profecy. I tried to contact him through email but he doesn't seem to answer. So I'll go talk to him in person, it's not that far from here. 
    
    Talk to you later, bye.

    Well. I don't quite know what to say. I mean, how can we be sure that this is even true? We don't even have the whole transcript.
    But, to be honest, it got me interested. More because I have nothing else to do than because it's something amazing.
    
    Did you find anything else in the computer? Give me access to it and I'll take a look.
    
    I think it's a good idea for you to talk with some people, but be careful, people will think that you're crazy and you'll know what that means.

        Hey Seventeen, how's going? I've come upon something interesting today. As you know, I often go just outside the zone to look for old computers.
    Today I found one, unamed, undated, but looked very old. I managed to recover some data from its solid state drive, and there is this file in there,
    that looks like a transcript of a presentation by some important person from way back. Here's what I could recover:
        
        "Today we've [lost_data] the [lost_data] we set out many [lost_data] ago. To [lost_data] and catalog all [lost_data]. I'm [lost_data] in front of [lost_data] to announce that we've [lost_data] single book. [lost_data] every single [lost_data] there is.
        All of this [lost_data] is being [lost_data] to our brand new [lost_data], one specially built for this. One that could endure any [lost_data] that human kind has seen. [lost_data] can penetrate this facility.
        We are, for all purpuses, creating a time capsule with all [lost_data] in the hopes that, if anything would happen [lost_data]."
        
        I know you don't believe in the profecy, but this sure sounds a lot like it. I thought that if anyone could find more about this would be you.
        I'll try to find more info on the computer and talk to some people about the profecy or this person in the transcript. Maybe one of the elders will know something.
        
        Talk to you soon,
        Bye.
