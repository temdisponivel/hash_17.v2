	I just received an email from Jo about this computer she hacked in. She told me about this file, supposably a transcript of some sort of presentation. Anyway, the transcription says something about a server containing all of human knowledge up to 2037. It's a very old computer, Jo found it on the ruins of a house just outside the zone. [She likes to look for these old computers to traine her hackins skills]. The file date is 10/10/2040. What is interesting about this is that the transcript says something very similar to the profecy. I don't quite believe in coincidences, but I also don't believe in profecies, so I'm kind of intriged by all this. If  it's true, this server could hold information that could help us rebuild our society again. It could also have lots os interesting stuff to see, read and play. That information could really be worth something. And, let's be honest here, if there's somebody who could find that server, it's me. I think I've just found my new task; thank god, I was so bored that I don't think I could last much longer here. I should send an email to Jo to see if she found something new.
